Apache Lucene Search Engine Implementation. The Search Engine Indexes a collection of files (Cranfield Collection) using IndexFiles.java. 
Cran folder contains a query file used to search the Index, using the SearchFiles.java file. 
Trec_eval is then used to compare the scores of the search engine against recommended scores.
